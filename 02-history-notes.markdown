# History

- Plan 9's full name is Plan 9 from Bell Labs, a reference to a cult B-movie called Plan 9 from Outer Space

- It was developed at Bell Labs by the Computer Science Research Center, by a team composing of many of the creators of UNIX, which was also developed at Bell Labs.

- Plan 9 was intended to replace UNIX as Bell Labs' primary research operating system

- When Plan 9 was beginning development, general trends in computing were moving away from monolithic time-sharing systems, towards smaller networked machines, and Plan 9 was designed to reflect this.

- After about a decade of development, AT&T (who owned Bell Labs at the time) put Plan 9 on the back-burner to focus on Inferno, the intended competitor to Sun's Java platform.

- Since then, Plan 9 has been released to the public in various forms.

- In 2000, the third edition was released under an Open Source license, and in 2002, the fourth edition was released under the Lucent Public License, an FSF-approved Free software license.

- Unofficial development on Plan 9 code continues to this day in the form of forks like 9front and 9atom.
