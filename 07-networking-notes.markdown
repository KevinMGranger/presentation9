# Networking

- Berkely Sockets? Eww.

- /net/tcp:
	- read from a clone file, write commands to its ctl
	- 9front's http server is a shell script...

- Like mentioned before:
	- Distributed "everything"
	- Plan 9 cluster

- IL
	- TCP is stream-based
	- UDP isn't reliable
	- Need message-based but reliable...
	-"In Plan 9, the implementation of IL is smaller and faster than TCP. IL is our main Internet transport protocol. "[1]
